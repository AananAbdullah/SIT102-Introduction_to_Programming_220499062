    <h2>A Walk to Remember</h2>
    <p>  In Beaufort, North Carolina, popular and rebellious high school senior Landon Carter and his friends have partaken in underage drinking on school grounds. They lure a new student, Clay Gephardt, to a factory in the hopes of "pranking" him, with the façade that this is an initiation task into their elite friendship group. However, Clay becomes seriously injured, which is brought to the attention of the school principal through law enforcement. In an effort to avoid law involvement, the school principal gives Landon the choice of being expelled from the school or completing several service projects which include weekend tutoring, janitorial duties, and participation in the school play. Choosing the latter, Landon is further acquainted with Jamie Sullivan, the local Baptist minister's daughter. He never befriended her due to the status quo at the high school, though he has known her most of his life.
        Landon begins to struggle with the play and reluctantly seeks guidance from Jamie, who agrees to help him on the condition that he will not fall in love with her, but Landon dismisses it as a foolish idea. They begin practicing together at her house after school. A bond begins to form between the two until Landon is rude to Jamie at school to impress his friends, and Jamie realizes that Landon wants to keep their friendship a secret from others, so she decides to distance herself from him.
        On the opening night of the play, Jamie astounds Landon and the audience with her voice and beauty. When Jamie finishes singing towards the end, Landon impulsively kisses her just before the curtain closes. Afterwards, Jamie avoids Landon until his friends play a cruel prank on her, led by Belinda, his resentful ex-girlfriend who wants them to reconcile despite Landon's lack of interest. In opposition to his friends, he defends her and she eventually warms up to him again. Landon asks Jamie to go on a date, to which Jamie reveals that she is not allowed to date. Landon visits the church in order to ask her father for permission. Jamie's father is initially hesitant but agrees.
        Their first date is a success, and it leads to another. Their relationship strengthens as they genuinely fall for each other, and all seems well. During a date, however, Jamie confesses that she is not making any plans for the future because she has leukemia and has not been responding to treatment. Jamie's condition grows worse and she gets sent to the hospital. Landon drives off to beg for help from his estranged father who is a doctor, asking him to help Jamie. Landon drives back in tears after feeling disappointed by his father's inability to help. Upon learning of her condition, Landon's friends come to him and apologize for their past treatment of Jamie and offer their support. While she is admitted, Jamie gives Landon a book that once belonged to her deceased mother and tells him that Landon is her angel. Unbeknownst to Landon, Jamie is given private home care by Landon's father to relieve her father's financial burden.
        Landon builds a telescope for Jamie to see a one-time comet in the springtime, and with help from Jamie's father, he finishes it in time to give Jamie a view of the comet. It is then that Landon asks her to marry him. Jamie tearfully accepts, and they get married in the church where her mother was married. Landon reflects that their last summer together was spent as husband and wife, and that she had died soon after.
        Years later, Landon returns to Beaufort to visit Jamie's father, revealing that he had been accepted into medical school. Landon laments that Jamie was never able to witness a miracle, to which Jamie's father replied that the miracle was Landon himself. Hereafter, Landon expresses sorrow over Jamie's passing, but describes their love like the wind: he cannot see it, but he can feel it.

    <h2>Inception</h2>
    <p>Dominick "Dom" Cobb and Arthur are "extractors"; they perform corporate espionage using experimental military technology to infiltrate their targets' subconscious and extract information through a shared dream world. Their latest target, Saito, reveals he arranged their mission to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: implanting an idea in a person's subconscious, or "inception". Saito wants Cobb to convince Robert, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, to dissolve his father's company. Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, which prevents him from returning home to his children.
        Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, an identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist with a sedative for the "dream within a dream" strategy; and Ariadne – an architecture student of his father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles – tasked with designing the dream's labyrinth. Ariadne discovers that Cobb's subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife, Mal. After Fischer dies, the team accompanies Robert on a flight where they sedate him into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a "kick" to awaken other team members from the deeper dream. These kicks must occur simultaneously, despite time flowing faster in each successive level.
        The first level is Yusuf's dream of Los Angeles. The team abducts Robert but is attacked by projections from his subconscious. Saito is wounded, and Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally waken dreamers, the sedatives will instead send them into "limbo": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest that Robert reconsider his father's will. Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing technology. Sedated for five hours of real-time, they spent fifty years in a dream world. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a form of inception by reactivating her totem, an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to "wake up", she committed suicide and framed Cobb to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in Miles' care.
        Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning and that Cobb is his subconscious protector, leading Robert yet another level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates a fortified mountain hospital dreamed by Eames and holds off the guards as Saito takes Robert into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, pursued by Robert's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge, initiating his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level, and removes gravity on Arthur's level, forcing Arthur to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges at Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter limbo to rescue Robert and Saito, while Eames prepares a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.
        Cobb makes peace with Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes up Robert with a kick. Revived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb searches for Saito in limbo, the others ride the kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving at Los Angeles International Airport, Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint and Miles accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's totem – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children

    <h2>Set It Up</h2>
    <p>Harper Moore is the 25-year-old assistant to Kirsten Stevens, a former journalist and now editor of an online sports journalism empire. Charlie Young is a 28-year-old assistant to the high-strung venture capitalist Rick Otis. Both work in the same building and meet one night when their bosses need dinner. Harper has ordered dinner for herself and Kirsten, but has no cash on her to pay for it; Charlie, who was not able to order dinner for his boss, pays for it to give to Rick. After Harper tells him she will be fired if she does not return with food, Charlie reluctantly allows her to take one of the meals.
        While meeting Charlie the next day to reimburse him for the cost of the food, Harper expresses surprise that Charlie would work for such an abrasive and demanding boss. Charlie reveals that Rick is well-connected and a recommendation from him would guarantee his financial success. Harper expresses her deep admiration of Kirsten and her desire to write the sort of sports journalism that would make people cry. After complaining that they have no time for their personal lives, Harper jokes that both of their bosses need to get laid. Charlie is initially disgusted by the comment, but after some thought, Harper plans to get their bosses together, reasoning that if they are dating each other, they would have less time to overwork herself and Charlie. Charlie reluctantly joins in on the plan.
        Their initial plot to have Rick and Kirsten "meet cute" in a stalled elevator goes awry when they are joined by a delivery man suffering from claustrophobia who starts stripping and urinating. Charlie and Harper then arrange for their bosses to sit beside each other at a baseball game, bribing the operator of the kiss-cam to pressure them into kissing. After three attempts, Rick and Kirsten kiss. They begin dating, leaving Charlie time to spend with his model girlfriend Suze, and Harper time to date.
        However things between Rick and Kirsten quickly become bumpy, causing Harper and Charlie to realize they must work hard to keep their bosses together. They manipulate their bosses into staying together by planning dates, leaving notes and gifts, and organizing a weekend getaway for them. Harper is able to attend her best friend Becca's engagement party. When her date ditches her, Charlie accompanies her and the two have an enjoyable night.
        After their vacation, Rick and Kirsten return and inform their assistants they are engaged. She confronts Charlie and is disappointed to learn that he knew about it and still wants Kirsten and Rick to get married.
        Harper goes to Kirsten and explains that she and Charlie manipulated them into dating; as she starts to tell her about Rick, Kirsten fires her and plans to go on with the wedding. Charlie, realizing he doesn't love Suze, breaks up with her and runs to the airport, where he quits his job and tells Kirsten that Rick doesn't love her and doesn't know her at all. Kirsten realizes it's true and breaks up with Rick.
        Harper goes through a crisis, but eventually decides to start writing again after a pep talk from Becca. Charlie is approached by Rick, who asks for his help in reuniting with his ex-wife, whom he actually still cares for. Charlie turns over a folder he has on Rick's ex-wife. Harper goes to her office to pick up her things and runs into Kirsten, who tries to hire her back. Harper refuses, telling her she needs to focus on her writing. Kirsten offers to help edit her article.
        As she is leaving, Harper sees Charlie, who has been called there by Kirsten. They realize that Kirsten is attempting to set them up. Charlie reveals that he quit his job and now works as a temp. The film ends with the two sharing a kiss upon realizing that they care for each other, despite having many reasons to dislike each other.
